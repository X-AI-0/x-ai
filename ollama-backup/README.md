# Ollama Manual Download Backup

This folder is used for manual Ollama downloads when automatic downloads fail.

## Instructions:

1. **Download Ollama manually** from one of these sources:
   - GitHub Latest: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/latest
   - Direct v0.9.0: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/download/v0.9.0/ollama-windows-amd64.zip
   - Mirror: https://mirror.ghproxy.com/https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/download/v0.9.0/ollama-windows-amd64.zip

2. **Download the Windows version**: Look for `ollama-windows-amd64.zip`

3. **Place the file here**: Move the downloaded ZIP file to this folder

4. **Keep the filename**: Make sure the file is named exactly `ollama-windows-amd64.zip`

5. **Retry installation**: Go back to the Models page and click "Install Ollama" again

## File Requirements:
- Filename: `ollama-windows-amd64.zip`
- Size: Should be approximately 1.6GB (1600+ MB)
- Type: ZIP archive containing Ollama executable

## Troubleshooting:
- If the file is too small (< 100MB), it might be an error page instead of the actual file
- Make sure you downloaded the Windows AMD64 version
- Check that your browser didn't rename the file

The installer will automatically detect and use this file instead of downloading from the internet.
